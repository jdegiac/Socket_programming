# Socket_programming
Client/Server TCP connection written in C

Very basic connection on local host using port 9002 (use a port > 1024)

Can be tested using two linux based terminal windows/tabs

Client terminal commands:

make TCP_clinet

./TCP_client

Server terminal commands:

make TCP_server

./TCP_server
